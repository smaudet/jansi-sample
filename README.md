This is a quick example project for JANSI, since I couldn't find any online.

To run the project you must:

* Have java 1.7 on your path
* Have maven 3 on your path
* Be connected to the internet
* Run 'runJansi' - and view the sample!

That's it - windows and *nix scripts are provided.

This was the sole exception of the following GIST:

To make things easier for others to test their JANSI is working, I've created
this example in project form, with a run script ready to go. I may attempt to
build a fancier example, perhaps something with some ascii art. ;)
